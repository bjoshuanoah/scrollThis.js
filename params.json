{"name":"scrollThis.js","body":"### Welcome to scrollThis.js\r\nJoin the revolution! A clean scroller that doesn't break after 30 seconds on the site or web app. No frills, it just works. Easy installation:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Place the scrollThis.js file into your javascript folder, and reference the file after jQuery, jQueryui, and jQuery.mousewheel, but before any other event or function JS files.\r\n2. Make sure the div you want to scroll is inside container div. scrollThis only scrolls the first element inside of a div, so if you want to scroll a list, make sure to reference the container of the \\<ul\\>, not the \\<u\\l> itself.\r\n3. Make sure the container div has a set (max)height, and has overflow set to hidden. We will not take care of this for you.\r\n4. Load your scrollThis() function inside of  $(document).ready();. Reference the element using jQuery $('#container') as the argument. Either inside of another JS file, or directly in the markup as follows: \r\n\r\n```\r\n   scrollThis($('#container'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, make sure to check out the example files.\r\n\r\n### Dependancies\r\n\r\n1.jQuery\r\n2.jQueryui(you can use the custom minified version that includes JUST draggable events\r\n3.jQuery.mousewheel\r\n\r\nAll of these are included in the repo\r\n\r\n### What about mobile?\r\nMobile can take care of itself. How? in general mobile browsers take care of scrolling divs very well. We're not adding any functionality here; no drag to refresh or anything. This is a simple lightweight plugin specifically for getting rid of ugly scrollbars on desktop browsers.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAs of this writing, sole contributor and author of this plugin is Brian Noah\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFind contact info here: https://github.com/bjoshuanoah","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
